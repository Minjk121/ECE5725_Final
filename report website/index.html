      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">In the modern day and age, the average university student is accompanied by their phone, which is often connected to campus Internet. Of course, they may also be carrying their laptop, their tablet, and other electronic equipment. When these devices are connected to the Internet through Wireless Access Points, the resulting traffic data, when drilled down to the physical location level, can serve as a measurement of the level of campus congestion across campus.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">This project utilizes the public Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) <a href="http://mrtg.cit.cornell.edu/">website</a> full of information as provided by Cornell's IT department. By leveraging the network traffic data of the Local Area Network (LAN)'s switch ports, we are able to look under the hood at the network that services the wireless access on Cornell's campus. Utilizing this, our project is able to take the incoming and outgoing traffic data from multiple Access Points (AP), consolidate for total traffic categorized a given room (such as the Duffield Atrium or CIS Lounge), and create a graphical representation merged with a map of the Engineering Quad of campus for red, yellow, and green levels of campus congestion. The project also creates a list of recommended study spaces in the Engineering buildings ranked in least to greatest amount of campus congestion, and can recommended "routes" through campus that take into account the congestion levels of the intervening areas.</p>

            <li>Create a graphical representation over a map of the level of campus congestion in common areas</li>
            <li>Offer a ranked list of study spaces, prioritizing the ones with the least amount of campus congestion, and offer routes to get there</li>
            <li>Have the user be able to control the progression through the menus and select options with either mouse clicks on a computer monitor, or by "remote control" buttons</li>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Design</h2>
              <h3>Phase 1: Data Acquisition</h3>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">This project has multiple moving parts. There is the data collection portion, which necessitates a way to pull the website traffic data from the individual Wireless APs that are scattered through campus, in rooms and in hallways. At first, we wanted to get a representation of this kind of network data by pinging the individual APs and comparing the ping latency against a calibrated threshold for an idea of how saturated with traffic the AP was. However, we soon found that due to the structure of the campus WiFi network, this nature of sleuthing was prohibitively difficult. The campus network are organized into clusters called <i>Nodes</i>, which are intra-building uplinks within each building's network room. Within each node (of which there are nine, ranging in geographical location from Clara Dickson to Goldwin Smith to Faris), individual buildings such as Phillips or Rhodes are serviced.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">In the end, we utilized the MRTG website and information as provided to us by Cornell IT. In this way we were able to find the actual incoming and outgoing data traffic (in kb/s or Mb/s) in real time of individual access points. Thus we were able to find the actual network traffic data to correlate to the level of campus congestion in different areas of campus, which we imported into a Pandas DataFrame using a webscraper and collated by physical location (determined by fieldwork, as the APs are sometimes named opaquely, such as RHODES-30042-3-AP: an AP in a hallway on the third floor of Rhodes).</p>
              <br><img src="img/rhodes_hallway_access_point.jpg" alt="route hallway access point" style="border:1px solid #000;width:30%;">
              <br><span style="text-align:center;">Rhodes Hallway Access Point</span>
              <br>

              <h3>Phase 2: Data Processing</h3>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">The next part of the project was smooth, as we were able to create a multiple-menu script in Python using pygame. The script imports the data from the webscraper and makes a determination of the level of campus congestion, and draws circles on a map of the Rhodes-Phillips-Duffield-Upson section of the Engineering Quad as a visual representation of the congestion data. We were able to determine threshold levels by fieldwork and observation correlating the number of people in individual areas and the amount of Internet traffic through the APs. Utilizing this data, we were also able to successfuly create a ranked list of recommended study spaces on campus and recommended a "route" to get there based on the congestion level in the intervening areas, which we programmed using a route flowchart.</p>
              <br>

              <h3>Phase 3: User Interface Decisions</h3>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">We wanted to use a smart mirror. However, in the testing process we foudn out that this would have not been practical within the constraints, nor necessary for what we wanted to do, so we dropped it. There is more information in the Testing section about this design decision.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">We briefly considered somehow uploading our map and associated work to a webserver so that any student on the RedRover WiFi would be able to access the data and congestion map. We researched into various ways to do this, including setting up an Apache webserver on the Raspberry Pi to host a website. However, we ran into difficulties doing this, and  in the interest of time eventually decided to not utilize webservers. More information about the testing that occurred before making this design decision can be found in the Testing section.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">The current project desing utilizes a piTFT and monitor-based user interface. The mouse allows the user to physically click buttons on the monitor to select options on a menu, as well as offering buttons on the piTFT to do the same. The following buttons allow for this functionality:
                <ul style="text-align:left;">
                  <li>Button 27 (on piTFT): dynamic, choice that is closest to top of screen</li>
                  <li>Button 23 (on piTFT): dynamic, choice that is below that of Button 27</li>
                  <li>Button 22 (on piTFT): dynamic, choice that is below that of Button 23</li>
                  <li>Button 17 (on piTFT): dynamic, choice that is below that of Button 22</li>
                  <li>Button 26 (on breadboard): static, Main Menu</li>
                  <li>Button 13 (on breadboard): static, Quit/Exit to Terminal</li>
                </ul>

              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum lorem nulla, consectetur at leo vel, pretium bibendum nisl. </p>

              <h3>Testing Webserver Feasability</h3>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">When it became clear that utilizing the smart mirror would be unrealistic given the constraints at the time, we switched gears to examine other avenues of user interface. One of the things we considered was somehow hosting the PyGame window on a webserver, accessible to anyone on the RedRover network by typing in the IP address of the hosting Raspberry Pi in a web browser. However, complications arose. Although we were able to successfully download, install, and host a small website on the Pi with Apache, we discovered that it is not possible to upload a PyGame script onto a webserver. We explored options to convert the PyGame script to JavaScript, or even modules such as <a href="https://gatc.ca/projects/pyjsdl/">pyjsdl</a> that would allow us to compile PyGame/Python scripts to JavaScript. However, although we downloaded, installed, and tried various debugging methods, we could not get the compilers to work on the Pi - even on other, simpler PyGame example scripts. Thus, we discarded the possibility of using a webserver to host the congestion map and menu as infeasible without extensive effort.</p>
